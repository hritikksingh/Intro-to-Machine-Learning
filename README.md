In this I have used Decision Tree to predict the price of houses in Melbourne.
Then we found that with this model we got a mean absolute error of 270k approx. 
So we then used random forest to make it accurate and we got 70k less MAE which is equal to 200k approx.
This is just me doing some basic predictions, if anyone looking at this repo is finding it inefficient then it is just because I am new to this :)
Thank you.
